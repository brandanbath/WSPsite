	<h3>Site Intent</h3>
		<p class="answers">The overall intent for the company "Signs by Design" is to 
		showcase their work, which is clearly a big deal in the signage industry, because 
		from what they showcase on their website as of right now has quite a few big names.
		
		The overall goal for the company, is to bring new clients who are anywhere from 
		startup companies to fortune 500 companies. Unfortunately this goal is not being 
		met very well at all. The work quality is there, but the website itself does not
		represent and showcase those qualities that they may have.
		
		This is where visitors who are future clients will drop off from the website, 
		and not even take it seriously. In an industry where there are plenty of
		other companies one could go to, you really have to set yourself apart from
		the others. It needs to be straight forward, clean, simple and easy to use.
		
		That is where the end-users goal comes in, which is not being met either,
		because the users goal is to visit the site, read what you're about, view
		your previous work, and inquire for future business.
		
		We are going to take the content that "Signs by Design" has currently up on their
		website, and restructure and deliver it to the consumer in a way that it is
		going to make the consumer want to contact you to get a quote.
		
		The overall re-design structure/concept is simple, it just needs to be thought 
		out correctly and professionally.</p>
		
		
	<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
		<h5>Overview</h5>
			<p class="answers">The best place in the signage industry for "Signs by Design" is to be 
			represented very professionally, cleanly, and straight to the point. With 
			not very many pages to choose from, because when you are showcasing your 
			work, all you need is your home page, about, portfolio, and contact.
			
			The biggest re-structure in the pages is going to be the portfolio, which
			is going to be all on the same page with various headings, so you don't have
			to jump from page to page.</p>
			
		<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
			<h5>St. Clair Signs</h5>
			<p class="answers">This website "St. Clair Signs" has no data available online regarding
			their statistics, but by the looks of their actual business, they seem to 
			spend a little more time structuring their business offline, than online.</P>
			
			<h5>Eastern Signs</h5>
			<p class="answers">This website for "Eastern Signs" is ranked at 8,543,363 so there 
			is no historical data. As you have to be ranked 100,000 or above to 
			be able to retrieve that data. Although they do at least have a half 
			decent website.</P>
			
			<h5>Talley Sign Company</h5>
			<p class="answers">This website for "Talley Sign Company" again has no data due to it's 
			rankings, although their design has to be the best of which I've seen 
			throughout the duration of my search.
			
			With that being said, I understand why "Signs by Design" is lacking on 
			their web presence, but it is definitely not something to not focus on
			in some point of your business' life.</P>
			</ol>
			
			<h5>Website Keywords</h5>
			<p class="answers">Signs by Design, Taylors, South Carolina, custom signs, manufacture, 
			install, repair, maintain, refurbish, signage, materials, discount, 
			vehicle wraps, advertisements, vinyl cutter, laminator, digital printer, 
			graphics, small cars, 18 wheeler wraps, vehicles, car, truck, van, bus, 
			illuminated signs, survey, permit, lighting. 
			At this point the only thing holding back "Signs by Design" is their 
			lack of web presence, which is a big deal in today day in age, and it can 
			either make or break your relationship with a client.</p>
			
			<h5>Targeted Audience<h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Startup companies that plan to take their business to the 
				next level.</li>
				<li>Business' that are semi established, but still fairly new, yet are 
				making a decent income from their business.<li>
				<li>Well established companies that are looking for repair on their 
				current signage or a get a completely brand new signage.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are the main audiences that we strive to get the attention of, not
			just "Signs by Designs" work, but leaving the ball in the consumers court, 
			giving them the decision if they want to work with you or not, but winning 
			them over with your overall presence, work ethic, and quality.
			
			It isn't often that you come across many companies that have all three, so
			to be that small percentage that has all 3 of those traits is something that
			will boost your business that much more.
			
			To attract the attention of startup companies and business' looking 
			to take their business to the next level are the real winners, because 
			then through the life of their business, they will continue to return
			to you, knowing you deliver quality work.</p>
			
			<h5>Cases/Personas<h5>
				<p>The person that would be using and interacting with this site will vary 
				from medium to a higher income, as they do have extra cash within their 
				business to spend on the signage for advertising purposes.
				
				All this person would really want when they visit the website is to find 
				the info that they came to look for, and not have to dig deep into the 
				site, but have it accessible and easy to get to. From here they would 
				want to request a quote, so they would go to the contact page. This is 
				why I would recommend the 4 main pages, Home, About, Portfolio, and Contact. 
				This makes it short simple and doesn't frustrate the viewer. Which increases 
				the chances of them recommending you to one of their friends who may have 
				a business that is in need of signage.</p>
